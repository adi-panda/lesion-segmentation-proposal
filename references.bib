	abstract = {Background and Purpose—It is hypothesized that early diffusion-weighted imaging ({DWI}) lesions accurately estimate the size of the irreversibly injured core and thresholded perfusion-weighted imaging ({PWI}) lesions (time to maximum of tissue residue function [Tmax] {\textgreater}6 seconds) approximate the volume of critically hypoperfused tissue. With incomplete reperfusion, the union of baseline {DWI} and posttreatment {PWI} is hypothesized to predict infarct volume.
Methods—This is a substudy of Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution Study 2 ({DEFUSE} 2); all patients with technically adequate {MRI} scans at 3 time points were included. Baseline {DWI} and early follow-up {PWI} lesion volumes were determined by the {RAPID} software program. Final infarct volumes were assessed with 5-day fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and were corrected for edema. Reperfusion was defined on the basis of the reduction in {PWI} lesion volume between baseline and early follow-up {MRI}. {DWI} and {PWI} volumes were correlated with final infarct volumes.
Results—Seventy-three patients were eligible. Twenty-six patients with {\textgreater}90\% reperfusion show a high correlation between early {DWI} volume and final infarct volume (r=0.95; P{\textless}0.001). Nine patients with {\textless}10\% reperfusion have a high correlation between baseline {PWI} (Tmax {\textgreater}6 seconds) volume and final infarct volume (r=0.86; P=0.002). Using all 73 patients, the union of baseline {DWI} and early follow-up {PWI} is highly correlated with final infarct volume (r=0.94; P{\textless}0.001). The median absolute difference between observed and predicted final volumes is 15 {mL} (interquartile range, 5.5–30.2).
Conclusions—Baseline {DWI} and early follow-up {PWI} (Tmax {\textgreater}6 seconds) volumes provide a reasonable approximation of final infarct volume after endovascular therapy.  (Stroke. 2013;44:681-685.)},

	abstract = {This report summarizes the findings of the {GBD} 2010 (Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors) study for hemorrhagic stroke ({HS}). Multiple databases were searched for relevant studies published between 1990 and 2010. The {GBD} 2010 study provided standardized estimates of the incidence, mortality, mortality-to-incidence ratios ({MIR}), and disability-adjusted life years ({DALY}) lost for {HS} (including intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage) by age, sex, and income level (high-income countries [{HIC}]; low- and middle-income countries [{LMIC}]) for 21 {GBD} 2010 regions in 1990, 2005, and 2010. In 2010, there were 5.3 million cases of {HS} and over 3.0 million deaths due to {HS}. There was a 47\% increase worldwide in the absolute number of {HS} cases. The largest proportion of {HS} incident cases (80\%) and deaths (63\%) occurred in {LMIC} countries. There were 62.8 million {DALY} lost (86\% in {LMIC}) due to {HS}. The overall age-standardized incidence rate of {HS} per 100,000 person-years in 2010 was 48.41 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 45.44 to 52.13) in {HIC} and 99.43 (95\% {CI}: 85.37 to 116.28) in {LMIC}, and 81.52 (95\% {CI}: 72.27 to 92.82) globally. The age-standardized incidence of {HS} increased by 18.5\% worldwide between 1990 and 2010. In {HIC}, there was a reduction in incidence of {HS} by 8\% (95\% {CI}: 1\% to 15\%), mortality by 38\% (95\% {CI}: 32\% to 43\%), {DALY} by 39\% (95\% {CI}: 32\% to 44\%), and {MIR} by 27\% (95\% {CI}: 19\% to 35\%) in the last 2 decades. In {LMIC} countries, there was a significant increase in the incidence of {HS} by 22\% (95\% {CI}: 5\% to 30\%), whereas there was a significant reduction in mortality rates of 23\% (95\% {CI}: -3\% to 36\%), {DALY} lost of 25\% (95\% {CI}: 7\% to 38\%), and {MIR} by 36\% (95\% {CI}: 16\% to 49\%). There were significant regional differences in incidence rates of {HS}, with the highest rates in {LMIC} regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, and lowest rates in High Income North America and Western Europe. The worldwide burden of {HS} has increased over the last 2 decades in terms of absolute numbers of {HS} incident events. The majority of the burden of {HS} is borne by {LMIC}. Rates for {HS} incidence, mortality, and {DALY} lost, as well as {MIR} decreased in the past 2 decades in {HIC}, but increased significantly in {LMIC} countries, particularly in those patients ≤75 years. {HS} affected people at a younger age in {LMIC} than in {HIC}. The lowest incidence and mortality rates in 2010 were in High Income North America, Australasia, and Western Europe, whereas the highest rates were in Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. These results suggest that reducing the burden of {HS} is a priority particularly in {LMIC}. The {GBD} 2010 findings may be a useful resource for planning strategies to reduce the global burden of {HS}.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the {ISBI} challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and {DIC}) we won the {ISBI} cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent {GPU}.

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) with U-shaped architectures have dominated medical image segmentation, which is crucial for various clinical purposes. However, the inherent locality of convolution makes {CNNs} fail to fully exploit global context, essential for better recognition of some structures, e.g., brain lesions. Transformers have recently proven promising performance on vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, mainly due to their capability of modeling long-range dependencies. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity of attention makes existing Transformer-based models use self-attention layers only after somehow reducing the image resolution, which limits the ability to capture global contexts present at higher resolutions. Therefore, this work introduces a family of models, dubbed Factorizer, which leverages the power of low-rank matrix factorization for constructing an end-to-end segmentation model. Specifically, we propose a linearly scalable approach to context modeling, formulating Nonnegative Matrix Factorization ({NMF}) as a differentiable layer integrated into a U-shaped architecture. The shifted window technique is also utilized in combination with {NMF} to effectively aggregate local information. Factorizers compete favorably with {CNNs} and Transformers in terms of accuracy, scalability, and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art results on the {BraTS} dataset for brain tumor segmentation and {ISLES}'22 dataset for stroke lesion segmentation. Highly meaningful {NMF} components give an additional interpretability advantage to Factorizers over {CNNs} and Transformers. Moreover, our ablation studies reveal a distinctive feature of Factorizers that enables a significant speed-up in inference for a trained Factorizer without any extra steps and without sacrificing much accuracy. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/pashtari/factorizer.},

	abstract = {We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-{CNN}, extends Faster R-{CNN} by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-{CNN} is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-{CNN}, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-{CNN} is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the {COCO} suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-{CNN} outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the {COCO} 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our {CNN} is trained end-to-end on {MRI} volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.},

	volume = {100},
	doi = {10.1212/WNL.0000000000207219},
	abstract = {Background and objectives: 
Functional outcomes after stroke are strongly related to focal injury measures. However, the role of global brain health is less clear. Here, we examined the impact of brain age, a measure of neurobiological aging derived from whole brain structural neuroimaging, on post-stroke outcomes, with a focus on sensorimotor performance. We hypothesized that more lesion damage would result in older brain age, which would in turn be associated with poorer outcomes. Related, we expected that brain age would mediate the relationship between lesion damage and outcomes. Finally, we hypothesized that structural brain resilience, which we define in the context of stroke as younger brain age given matched lesion damage, would differentiate people with good versus poor outcomes.

Methods:
We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using a multi-site dataset of 3D brain structural {MRIs} and clinical measures from {ENIGMA} Stroke Recovery. Brain age was calculated from 77 neuroanatomical features using a ridge regression model trained and validated on 4,314 healthy controls. We performed a three-step mediation analysis with robust mixed-effects linear regression models to examine relationships between brain age, lesion damage, and stroke outcomes. We used propensity score matching and logistic regression to examine whether brain resilience predicts good versus poor outcomes in patients with matched lesion damage.

Results:
We examined 963 patients across 38 cohorts. Greater lesion damage was associated with older brain age (β=0.21; 95\% {CI} 0.04,0.38, P=0.015), which in turn was associated with poorer outcomes, both in the sensorimotor domain (β=-0.28; 95\% {CI}: -0.41,-0.15, P{\textless}0.001) and across multiple domains of function (β=-0.14; 95\% {CI}: -0.22,-0.06, P{\textless}0.001). Brain age mediated 15\% of the impact of lesion damage on sensorimotor performance (95\% {CI}: 3\%,58\%, P=0.01). Greater brain resilience explained why people have better outcomes, given matched lesion damage ({OR}=1.04, 95\% {CI}: 1.01,1.08, P=0.004).

Conclusions:
We provide evidence that younger brain age is associated with superior post-stroke outcomes and modifies the impact of focal damage. The inclusion of imaging-based assessments of brain age and brain resilience may improve the prediction of post-stroke outcomes compared to focal injury measures alone, opening new possibilities for potential therapeutic targets.},
