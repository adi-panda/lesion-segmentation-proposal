\par We will train our models using data from our local dataset,
as well as data from the ISLES 2022 challenge. The ISLES dataset consists 
of 250 subjects, with ADC, DWI, and FLAIR images. The dataset is split from
two centers, with 200 subjects from center one (\emph{University Hospital of the Technical
 University Munich, Munich, German}), containg acute to early sub-acute stroke data,
 and 50 subjects from center two (\emph{ University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany}), 
 containing hyper-acute to acute stroke data.
