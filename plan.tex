\par Our plan is to gather data from our locally sourced dataset containing
labeled FLAIR MRI images as well as data from the ISLES 2022 stroke segmnetation challenge. 
We will then preprocess the images, by injesting the Nifti files, and extracting
regions which could potetionally contain stroke lesions, as well as  
normalizing the image intensities. The preporcessed data will then be used
for training with the proposed models. We will be using the frontera system from
the Texas Advanced Computing Center, equipped with 4 NVIDIA RTX Quadro 5000s.
We will then evaluate the performance of our models using the five-fold cross validation, 
and evaluate metrics such as the DICE coefficient, lesion count, and F1 score.
