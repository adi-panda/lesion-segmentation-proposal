Our plan is to gather data from our locally sourced dataset, as well as
data from the ISLES 2022 challenge. We will then preprocess the data
and train our five models on the data. We will then evaluate the
performance of our models using the Dice coefficient as well as a
five-fold cross validation. We will also compare our models to the
state-of-the-art models from the ISLES 2022 challenge.
