Early localizaiton of lesion plays a vital role in prediction of
the final infarct volume and the clinical outcome of the stroke
patient. As demonsrated in \cite{lesk:1977}, growth of the lesion
volume during the initial MRI screenings, demonstrates a strong coorelation
with the final infarct volume.
